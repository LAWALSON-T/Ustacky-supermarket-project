USTACKY SUPERMARKET PROJECT


# Project Steps

Data extraction and stitching

# Insights

The Port Harcourt branch makes the most income but the Lagos branch makes the most sales
the most used mode of payment is Epay
The Health and beauty products are the cheapest but yet are still least sold products
The Electronic accessories are the most expensive products and genrates the most income
The Fashion accessories are the most sold product


# Future Work

I would like to analyze the staffs roster, their number , salary and shift
I would also have preferred more data spanning an entire year instead of just three months


# Standout Section

To further analyze the dataset, I employed the lambda function so as to have an insight on the day and month with the most sales
From these i deduced the most goods are sold on Saturday and Tuesday, the least goods are sold on Monday. Also considering February has the least amount of days it has the least amount of sales , while January has the highest amount of sales due its varying festive periods


# Executive Summary

Clearly the Abuja branch is struggling on sales due to its low rating , this might due to varying factors but I strongly advice a revamp on the customer service provided in that branch. Going by the economic and social standards of the state , being the federal capital, the sales should be alot better. The quality of services provided in the Abuja branch must improve.
